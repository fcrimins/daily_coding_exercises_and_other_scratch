    "The bottom line is some companies do ask questions like this, so it's worth being prepared. There are a bunch of these not-exactly-programming interview questions that lean on math and logic. There are some famous ones about shuffling cards and rolling dice. If math isn't your strong suit, don't fret. It only takes a few practice problems to get the hang of these."
